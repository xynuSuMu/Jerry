#### 题目

With the 2010 FIFA World Cup running, football fans the world over were becoming increasingly excited as the best players from the best teams doing battles for the World Cup trophy in South Africa. Similarly, football betting fans were putting their money where their mouths were, by laying all manner of World Cup bets.

Chinese Football Lottery provided a "Triple Winning" game. The rule of winning was simple: first select any three of the games. Then for each selected game, bet on one of the three possible results -- namely W for win, T for tie, and L for lose. There was an odd assigned to each result. The winner's odd would be the product of the three odds times 65%.

For example, 3 games' odds are given as the following:

```text
 W    T    L
1.1  2.5  1.7
1.2  3.1  1.6
4.1  1.2  1.1
```

To obtain the maximum profit, one must buy W for the 3rd game, T for the 2nd game, and T for the 1st game. If each bet takes 2 yuans, then the maximum profit would be (4.1×3.1×2.5×65%−1)×2=39.31 yuans (accurate up to 2 decimal places).

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains the betting information of 3 games. Each game occupies a line with three distinct odds corresponding to W, T and L.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the best bet of each game, and the maximum profit accurate up to 2 decimal places. The characters and the number must be separated by one space.

Sample Input:
```text
1.1 2.5 1.7
1.2 3.1 1.6
4.1 1.2 1.1

```

Sample Output:

```text
T T W 39.31

```

#### 思路

这道题最难的是翻译😏：大致的意思一支足球队伍，和三支队伍踢球，然后给定三组数据，每一组有三个赔率，分别代表W-获胜，T-平局，L-失败。
让我们计算出，如何下注能获利最多。

#### 实现代码(C++) PAT已验证通过

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

string con(int i){
    if (i%3==0) {
        return "W";
    }else if(i%3==1){
        return "T";
    }else{
        return "L";
    }
}
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    double odds[9];
    for (int i=0; i<9; i+=3) {
        cin>>odds[i]>>odds[i+1]>>odds[i+2];
    }
    string max[3];
    double result=1;
    int index = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<9; i+=3) {
        int maxV=i;
        for (int j=i+1; j<i+3; j++) {
            if (odds[j]>odds[maxV]) {
                maxV = j;
            }
        }
        result *=odds[maxV];
        max[index++] = con(maxV);
    }
    result = (result * 0.65-1) * 2;
    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {
        cout<<max[i]<<" ";
    }
    cout<<setiosflags(ios::fixed)<<setprecision(2)<<result;
    return 0;   
}
```
