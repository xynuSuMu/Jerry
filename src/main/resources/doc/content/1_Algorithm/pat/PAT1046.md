#### 题目

The task is really simple: given N exits on a highway which forms a simple cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of exits.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains an integer N (in [3,10<sup>5</sup>]), 
followed by N integer distances D​<sub>1</sub>D​<sub>2</sub>D​<sub>N</sub> 
where D​<sub>i</sub> is the distance between the i-th and the (i+1)-st exits, and D​<sub>N</sub>
 is between the N-th and the 1st exits. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space. 
 The second line gives a positive integer M (≤10​<sub>4</sub>), with M lines follow, each contains a pair of exit numbers, 
 provided that the exits are numbered from 1 to N. 
 It is guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than 10​<sub>7</sub>.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print your results in M lines, each contains the shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits.

Sample Input:
```text
5 1 2 4 14 9
3
1 3
2 5
4 1
```     
    
Sample Output:
```text
3
10
7
```

#### 思路

该题是求解全源最短路径，可以采用弗洛伊德算法去实现，但是这道题有更加简单的解体方案，因为题目说明，图是一个环，那么最短路径，
必须是规定查询的链表长度，或者环的长度减去链表的长度，两个值最小值就是最对路径

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    
    int N;
    scanf("%d",&N);
    int link[N+1];
    link[0] = 0;
    for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) {
        scanf("%d",&link[i]);
        link[i] +=link[i-1];
    }
    int queryNum;
    scanf("%d",&queryNum);
    int u,v;
    int res[queryNum];
    for (int i=0; i<queryNum; i++) {
        scanf("%d %d",&u,&v);
        if (v<u) {
            int temp = v;
            v = u;
            u = temp;
        }
        int vlaue = link[v-1]-link[u-1];
        res[i]=min(vlaue,link[N]-vlaue);
    }
    for (int n=0; n<queryNum; n++) {
        printf("%d\n",res[n]);
    }
    //
    return 0;
}
