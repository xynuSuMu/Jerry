#### 题目

Mice and Rice is the name of a programming contest in which each programmer must write a piece of code to control the movements of a mouse in a given map. The goal of each mouse is to eat as much rice as possible in order to become a FatMouse.

First the playing order is randomly decided for N​P​​ programmers. Then every N​G​​ programmers are grouped in a match. The fattest mouse in a group wins and enters the next turn. All the losers in this turn are ranked the same. Every N​G​​winners are then grouped in the next match until a final winner is determined.

For the sake of simplicity, assume that the weight of each mouse is fixed once the programmer submits his/her code. Given the weights of all the mice and the initial playing order, you are supposed to output the ranks for the programmers.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive integers: N​P​​ and N​G​​ (≤), the number of programmers and the maximum number of mice in a group, respectively. If there are less than N​G​​ mice at the end of the player's list, then all the mice left will be put into the last group. The second line contains N​P​​ distinct non-negative numbers W​i​​ (,) where each W​i​​ is the weight of the i-th mouse respectively. The third line gives the initial playing order which is a permutation of 0 (assume that the programmers are numbered from 0 to N​P​​−1). All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print the final ranks in a line. The i-th number is the rank of the i-th programmer, and all the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

**Sample Input:**

```text
11 3
25 18 0 46 37 3 19 22 57 56 10
6 0 8 7 10 5 9 1 4 2 3
```

**Sample Output:**

```text
5 5 5 2 5 5 5 3 1 3 5
```

#### 思路

题的大意是对于指定数量NP只的老鼠进行分组，每组NG只，最后不足NG只的算作一组，然后每组选择最胖的老鼠进入下一组，直到最后只剩下一只老鼠。

那么NP只老鼠分按每组NG只分，可以向上取整得到分组数group。最后对于每一组获胜的老鼠，放入下一轮的比较中。

这里可以使用队列，每次获胜的老鼠继续放入队列中，直到队列只剩下一只老鼠。

#### 实现代码(C++) PAT已验证通过

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

struct Mouse{
    int index,weight,ranking;
};

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    int NP,NG;
    scanf("%d %d",&NP,&NG);
    queue<Mouse> que;
    Mouse mouses[NP];
    Mouse mouse;
    for (int i=0; i<NP; ++i) {
        scanf("%d",&mouse.weight);
        mouses[i] = mouse;
    }
    int index;
    for (int i=0; i<NP; ++i) {
        scanf("%d",&index);
        mouses[index].index = index;
        que.push(mouses[index]);
    }
    
    int temp = NP,group;
    while (que.size()>1) {
        //向上取整分组
        group=(ceil)(temp*1.0/NG);
        //每一组拿到winner
        for (int i=0; i<group; i++) {
            mouse = que.front();
            for (int j=0; j<NG; ++j) {
                if (i*NG+j>=temp) break;
                
                if (que.front().weight>mouse.weight) {
                    mouse = que.front();
                }
                mouses[que.front().index].ranking = group + 1;
                que.pop();
            }
            que.push(mouse);
        }
        temp = group;
    }
    mouses[que.front().index].ranking = 1;
    for (int i=0;i<NP;i++) {
        printf("%d",mouses[i].ranking);
        if (i!=NP-1) {
            printf(" ");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
