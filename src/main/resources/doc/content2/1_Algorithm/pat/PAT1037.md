#### 题目

The magic shop in Mars is offering some magic coupons. Each coupon has an integer N printed on it, 
meaning that when you use this coupon with a product, 
you may get N times the value of that product back! What is more, 
the shop also offers some bonus product for free. However, 
if you apply a coupon with a positive N to this bonus product, 
you will have to pay the shop N times the value of the bonus product... but hey, 
magically, they have some coupons with negative N's!

For example, given a set of coupons { 1 2 4 −1 }, 
and a set of product values { 7 6 −2 −3 } (in Mars dollars M$) where a negative value corresponds to a bonus product. 
You can apply coupon 3 (with N being 4) to product 1 (with value M$7) to get M$28 back; coupon 2 to product 2 to get M$12 back; 
and coupon 4 to product 4 to get M$3 back. On the other hand, if you apply coupon 3 to product 4, 
you will have to pay M$12 to the shop.

Each coupon and each product may be selected at most once. Your task is to get as much money back as possible.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, 
the first line contains the number of coupons N<sub>​C</sub>
​​ , followed by a line with N<sub>​C</sub>
 coupon integers. Then the next line contains the number of products N<sub>​P</sub>
, followed by a line with N<sub>​P</sub> product values. Here 1≤N<sub>​C</sub>,N<sub>​P</sub> ≤10<sup>5</sup>
​​ , and it is guaranteed that all the numbers will not exceed 2<sup>30</sup>.

Output Specification:

For each test case, simply print in a line the maximum amount of money you can get back.

Sample Input:
```text
4
1 2 4 -1
4
7 6 -2 -3
```    
    
Sample Output:
```text
43
```


#### 思路

求最优解。给定优惠券数字组合和产品数字组合，如何搭配才能使得获利最大。

比如优惠券coupon{ 1 2 4 −1 },产品product{ 7 6 −2 −3 }。两两搭配相乘，结果正数未获利。负数为扣款。
那么最大获利就是 4*7+2*6+（-1） * （-3） = 43。

代码实现关键就是排序规则，不能单纯的从大到小的排，在负数的时候，要从小到大排列。
再遍历计算得到结果。

#### 实现代码(C++) PAT已验证通过

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool cmp(int a,int b){
    if (a<0 && b<0) {
        return a<b;
    }
    return a>b;
}
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    
    int NC;
    scanf("%d",&NC);
    int coupon[NC];
    int i;
    for (i=0; i<NC; i++) {
        scanf("%d",&coupon[i]);
    }
    int NP;
    scanf("%d",&NP);
    int produce[NP];
    for (i=0; i<NP; i++) {
        scanf("%d",&produce[i]);
    }
    sort(coupon, coupon+NC, cmp);
    sort(produce, produce+NP, cmp);
    
    int currProduct = 0;
    int bonus = 0;
    bool proNegative = false;
    for (i = 0;i<NC; i++) {
        int cou = coupon[i];
        if (cou==0 || (cou>0 && proNegative)) {
            continue;
        }
        for (int j=currProduct; j<NP; j++) {
            int pro = produce[j];
            if (pro == 0) {
                currProduct = j+1;
                continue;
            }
            if (cou >0 ) {
                if (pro>0) {
                    bonus +=cou*pro;
                    currProduct = j+1;
                }else{
                    proNegative = true;
                }
                break;

                if (pro<0) {
                    bonus +=cou*pro;
                    break;
                }else{
                    continue;
                }
            }
        }
   
    }
    printf("%d",bonus);
    return 0;
