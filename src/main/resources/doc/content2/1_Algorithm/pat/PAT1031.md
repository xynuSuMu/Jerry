####

Given any string of N (≥5) characters, you are asked to form the characters into the shape of U. For example, helloworld can be printed as:
```text
h  d
e  l
l  r
lowo
```   
    
That is, the characters must be printed in the original order, starting top-down from the left vertical 
line with n<sub>1</sub>
characters, then left to right along the bottom line with n<sub>2</sub>
 characters, and finally bottom-up along the vertical line with n<sub>3</sub>
​​ characters. And more, we would like U to be as squared as possible -- that is, it must be satisfied that n<sub>1</sub>
 =n<sub>3</sub>=max { k | k≤n<sub>2</sub>for all 3≤n<sub>2</sub>≤N } with n<sub>1</sub>
 +n<sub>2</sub>+n<sub>3</sub>−2=N.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains one string with no less than 5 and no more than 80 characters in a line. The string contains no white space.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print the input string in the shape of U as specified in the description.

Sample Input:
```text
helloworld!
```
      
    
Sample Output:
```text
h   !
e   d
l   l
lowor

```
#### 思路

该题关键点在于公式:

n1=n3<=n2;N = n1+n3+n2-2; 3<=n2<=N

N+2-n3=2n1

那么n1 <= (N+2)/3

也就是n1最大为(N+2)/3；那么n2也就得到结果
